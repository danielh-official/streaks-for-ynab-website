# Terms of Use

**Effective Date:** October 22, 2025

Thank you for choosing Streaks (For YNAB) (referred to as “we,” “our,” or “us”). These Terms of Use
(“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Streaks (For YNAB) mobile application (also referred
to as "Streaks") and related services (collectively, the “Licensed Application” or “Service”). By
downloading, installing, or using Streaks, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Acknowledgement

These Terms are between you and Daniel Haven (“Developer”), not the app store operator (the
“Platform Provider,” e.g., Apple). The Developer is solely responsible for Streaks For YNAB and its
content. These Terms do not override the Platform Provider’s own usage rules, which you acknowledge
you have had the opportunity to review.

## 2. Scope of License

You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use Streaks for
personal purposes:

- On devices you own or control, in line with the Platform Provider’s usage rules.
- By other accounts associated with you through Family Sharing, volume purchasing, or equivalent
  programs where supported.

## 3. License Restrictions

You may not:

- Copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on Streaks
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to extract source code.
- Rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise commercialize Streaks.
- Use Streaks for unlawful, fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes.
- Circumvent, disable, or interfere with security features of Streaks or the Platform Provider.

## 4. Maintenance and Support

Developer is solely responsible for maintenance and support of Streaks. The Platform Provider has no
obligation to furnish any such services.

## 5. Warranty

Developer is solely responsible for any warranties for Streaks, whether express or implied by law,
to the extent not effectively disclaimed. If Streaks fails to conform to a warranty, you may notify
the Platform Provider, which may refund the purchase price (if applicable). To the maximum extent
permitted by law, the Platform Provider has no other warranty obligation, and all other claims are
the responsibility of the Developer.

## 6. Product Claims

Developer, not the Platform Provider, is responsible for addressing any claims by you or third
parties relating to Streaks or its use, including:

- product liability;
- non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements;
- consumer protection, privacy, or similar claims.

## 7. Intellectual Property Rights

If a third party claims Streaks infringes their intellectual property rights, Developer, not the
Platform Provider, will handle the investigation, defense, settlement, and resolution.

## 8. Legal Compliance

You represent and warrant that:

- you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo or designated as supporting
  terrorism;
- you are not on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- Streaks is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind.
- Developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
  damages arising out of or related to your use of Streaks.
- Developer’s total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for Streaks
  in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to Streaks at any time, with or without notice, if you
violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use Streaks immediately ceases.

## 11. Developer Information

Streaks is developed and maintained by:

**Daniel Haven** <br /> **Email**: {{ site.email }} <br /> **Website**:
{{ site.copyright.owner.url }}

Questions, complaints, or claims regarding Streaks should be directed to the Developer.

## 12. Third Party Terms

When using Streaks, you must comply with any applicable third-party terms (e.g., your wireless data
provider’s agreement when using Streaks over a data connection).

## 13. Third Party Beneficiary

You and the Developer acknowledge that the Platform Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party
beneficiaries of these Terms. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, they will have the right to
enforce them against you.
